# Explanation of Options
# Any settings not set will use defaults, shown in [brackets]
# 
# [app]
# update rate in seconds; default = 1/60
#
# [image]
# full_threshold:   full-frame threshold for image processing, as a percentage
#                       70.0 means all pixels less than 70% of saturation are
#                       set to zero for image processing (centroid, FWHM)
# roi_threshold:    same as full_threshold, but for the region of interest
#                       sub-image
# use_roi_stats:    true to use the region of interest for all image processing,
#                       false to use the full frame
#
# [camera]
# run_mode:     ["NORMAL"] (streaming video) or "TRIGGER" (single exposure)
# bits:         camera bitrate [8] or 12
# freq_mode:    freq = full_speed / (2^freq_mode), is one of [0], 1, 2, 3, 4
# resolution:   camera resolution: [1280, 960]
# bin_mode:     camera bin mode is one of
#                   ["NO_BIN"], "BIN1X2", "BIN1X3", "BIN1X4", "SKIP"

# exposure:     exposure time in milliseconds, in increments of 0.05ms,
#                   default [50.0]
# fps:          "NORMAL" mode target frames per second, default [10.0]
# gain:         6 to 41 dB, inclusive, [15] dB recommended for "NO_BIN" mode,
#                   lower to 6-8 for binning modes

# [motion.limits]
# list all motion limits (both zaber & galil) as "name" = {min = XX, max = XX}

# "cfm1_az" = {min = -10.0, max = 10.0}
#
# [positioner]
# x_axis: name of axis to use as x-axis when positioning camera
